# The Link Between Vacant Lots, Crime, and Social Harms: A Research Summary

## Introduction

The presence of vacant lots in urban areas has long been a subject of concern for residents, policymakers, and researchers. These empty parcels of land are often seen as indicators of neighborhood decline and have been linked to a range of negative outcomes, including increased crime rates and various social harms. This research summary synthesizes findings from scientific literature to explore the complex relationship between vacant lots, crime, and social harms, and examines the impact of interventions aimed at mitigating these issues.

## Vacant Lots and Crime

A significant body of research has established a strong correlation between the presence of vacant lots and higher crime rates. The "broken windows" theory, a prominent criminological concept, posits that visible signs of disorder and neglect, such as vacant lots, can create an environment that encourages criminal activity by signaling a lack of social control [1].

### Key Findings from Research:

*   **Greening vacant lots reduces crime:** Multiple studies have demonstrated that the remediation and greening of vacant lots can lead to significant reductions in crime. A study in Philadelphia found that greening vacant lots was associated with a decrease in gun violence [2]. Another study in the same city revealed that neighborhoods where vacant lots were cleaned up experienced a 29% reduction in gun violence, a 22% decrease in burglaries, and a 30% reduction in other crimes [3].

*   **Context matters:** The effectiveness of vacant lot remediation in reducing crime can be influenced by the surrounding environment. Research has shown that the crime reduction benefits are smaller when vacant lots are located near train stations and alcohol outlets, which are often crime hotspots. Conversely, the positive impact is greater when remediated lots are situated near areas with active businesses [2].

*   **Community involvement is crucial:** Resident-led greening initiatives have been found to be particularly effective in reducing crime. When community members are involved in the transformation of vacant lots, it can foster a sense of ownership and collective efficacy, which in turn strengthens social control and deters criminal activity [4].

## Social Harms Associated with Vacant Lots and Urban Blight

Beyond their connection to crime, vacant lots and urban blight contribute to a range of social harms that can negatively impact the well-being of individuals and communities.

### Public Health Impacts:

*   **Mental Health:** The presence of vacant lots and abandoned buildings can contribute to mental distress, including depression, anxiety, and fear. The visual signs of decay and neglect can create a sense of hopelessness and despair among residents [5].

*   **Physical Health:** Vacant lots can pose direct threats to physical health. They can become dumping grounds for trash and hazardous materials, and attract pests such as rodents and insects, which can spread disease. Unkempt lots can also increase the risk of injuries, particularly for children who may play in these areas [6].

*   **Chronic Illness:** Studies have linked living in blighted neighborhoods to higher rates of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease. The stress associated with living in a deteriorated environment, combined with limited access to healthy food and recreational spaces, can contribute to these health disparities [7].

### Social and Economic Consequences:

*   **Decreased Property Values:** The presence of vacant lots and abandoned buildings can significantly lower the property values of surrounding homes and businesses. This can lead to a cycle of disinvestment, as property owners may be less willing to invest in a neighborhood that appears to be in decline [8].

*   **Erosion of Social Cohesion:** Urban blight can weaken the social fabric of a community. As residents become more fearful and isolated, they may be less likely to interact with their neighbors or participate in community activities. This breakdown in social cohesion can further exacerbate crime and other social problems [9].

## Interventions and Solutions

Recognizing the detrimental effects of vacant lots, many cities have implemented programs and policies aimed at transforming these spaces into community assets.

### Successful Strategies:

| Strategy | Description | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Greening Programs** | Cleaning, mowing, and planting vegetation on vacant lots. | Reduces crime, improves mental and physical health, and increases property values. |
| **Community Gardens** | Converting vacant lots into spaces for residents to grow food. | Improves access to healthy food, fosters social interaction, and beautifies the neighborhood. |
| **Land Banks** | Public or quasi-governmental entities that acquire and manage vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties. | Facilitates the transfer of vacant properties to responsible owners and developers for productive reuse. |
| **Strategic Code Enforcement** | Proactively identifying and addressing code violations on vacant properties. | Prevents properties from falling into disrepair and becoming blighted. |

## Conclusion

The scientific evidence is clear: vacant lots are not merely empty spaces but are closely linked to increased crime and a range of social harms that can have a profound impact on the well-being of individuals and communities. However, research also shows that these negative outcomes are not inevitable. Through targeted interventions such as greening programs, community gardens, and land banks, cities can transform vacant lots from liabilities into assets that contribute to safer, healthier, and more vibrant neighborhoods.
