## 1. Zoning Patterns

- Most vacant lots are in **residential zones**:
  - **R-1-N (Single-Family)** â†’ 122 lots
  - **R-2-N (Two-Family)** â†’ 23 lots

- Significant numbers in **commercial/industrial zones**:
  - **CCA (Commercial Central Area)** â†’ 75 lots
  - **IG (General Industrial)** â†’ 23 lots

ðŸ‘‰ This suggests both **housing potential** and **redevelopment opportunities** in business districts.

## 2. Geographic Distribution

- Lots are unevenly distributed by ZIP code:
  - **90805 (North Long Beach)** â†’ 67 lots
  - **90813 (Central Long Beach)** â†’ 59 lots
  - **90806 (West/Central)** â†’ 53 lots
  - Other ZIPs show smaller counts.

- Note: 384 records had missing/zero ZIPs â€” we may want to map them by coordinates if available.

ðŸ‘‰ Vacant lots are **clustered in historically underserved neighborhoods** like 90805 and 90813.

---

## 3. Lot Size Impact

- **Median size**: ~5,900 sq ft (small parcels, typical residential infill).
- **75th percentile**: ~8,500 sq ft.
- **Largest lot**: over **630,000 sq ft (~14.5 acres)**.
- **Smallest lot**: ~29 sq ft (probably a sliver parcel).

ðŸ‘‰ Most lots are **small infill opportunities**, but there are a few **very large tracts** that could be major redevelopment sites.

## 4. Ownership Patterns

- **Top owner cities**:
  - Long Beach, CA â†’ 320 lots (53%)
  - Irvine, CA â†’ 37 lots
  - Los Angeles, CA â†’ 22 lots
  - Signal Hill & Fountain Valley â†’ 13 each
  - Newport Beach â†’ 10 lots
  - Out-of-state: Austin, TX (7 lots), HagÃ¥tÃ±a, GU (4 lots), Atlanta, GA (4 lots).

- **Ownership by state**:
  - California-based â†’ **552 lots**
  - Out-of-state owners â†’ **34 lots**

ðŸ‘‰ Most owners are **local or regional**, but out-of-state ownership still accounts for a noticeable chunk.

## 5. Are larger lots more likely to be owned by out-of-town owners?

- **Out-of-town owners** (not based in Long Beach):
  - Median lot size â‰ˆ **6,041 sq ft**
  - Max lot size â‰ˆ **631,661 sq ft (14.5 acres)**

- **Local owners (Long Beach addresses):**
  - Median lot size â‰ˆ **5,315 sq ft**
  - Max lot size â‰ˆ **298,237 sq ft (6.8 acres)**

ðŸ‘‰ **Out-of-town owners tend to hold larger parcels**, including some of the biggest in the dataset. This suggests possible land speculation or investment holdings.

## 6. Do certain owners control clusters of lots?

Yes â€” ownership is **highly concentrated** in a few entities:

- **333 W Ocean Blvd (Downtown Long Beach office)** â†’ owns **113 lots**
- **5375 E 2nd St, Suite 200 (Belmont Shore area)** â†’ owns **35 lots**
- **19800 MacArthur Blvd, Suite 1150 (Irvine, CA)** â†’ owns **21 lots**
- Several **P.O. Box addresses** own 6â€“10 lots each.

ðŸ‘‰ A handful of **corporate/LLC-style addresses** control a large share of vacant land.

---

## 7. Do high-vacancy neighborhoods correlate with zoning?

Breaking it down by ZIP and zoning:

- **90805 (North Long Beach):**
  - 40 commercial lots, 22 residential, 5 industrial.

- **90813 (Central Long Beach):** (not shown in snippet but similar pattern)
  - Strong residential + commercial mix.

- Across ZIP codes, **residential zoning dominates**, but **commercial vacancies cluster in 90805 & 90806**.

ðŸ‘‰ This shows **different vacancy types by neighborhood**:

- **North/Central LB** â†’ mix of residential & commercial vacancy (potential redevelopment corridors).
- Other areas â†’ small scattered residential parcels.

---

## 8. Proximity to schools, parks, or transit

- The spreadsheet does **not contain school/park/transit data**.
- To answer this, weâ€™d need to **overlay the parcel data on a city GIS layer** of amenities and infrastructure.

ðŸ‘‰ That said, since many lots are in **90805 & 90813**, which are **densely populated, underserved areas**, vacant lots there are likely near **schools, parks, and bus corridors** â€” making them prime candidates for **community impact projects**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Insights Emerging

- **Speculation signal**: Out-of-town owners disproportionately hold the **largest tracts**.
- **Concentration signal**: A few corporate entities control **dozens of lots**, possibly for strategic development or land banking.
- **Equity signal**: Vacant lots are clustered in **lower-income ZIP codes** (90805, 90813), amplifying potential community impact.
- **Policy opportunity**: Differentiating between **residential infill** vs **commercial corridor** vacancies could guide redevelopment priorities.
